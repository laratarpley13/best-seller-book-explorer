# Best Seller Book Explorer
[published site]https://laratarpley13.github.io/best-seller-book-explorer/

Helps users find new books to read by exploring New York Times Best Sellers lists and corresponding video content from YouTube about the books and their authors.

## Motivation
I wanted to provide users with a new way to explore books and find their next read.

## About
![Alt text](https://github.com/laratarpley13/best-seller-book-explorer/blob/master/book-app-screen-shot.png)

Allows users to select a category from the most recent New York Times Best Sellers List and returns the book title, author, description of the book (if applicable), and the cover of the book.  The user is given the option to display the top videos returned by YouTube and given the option to watch them in the app. If the user is interested in looking into the book further, they are provided with a link that sends them to Amazon.com.

## Built With:
HTML, CSS, and Javascript using the jQuery library
